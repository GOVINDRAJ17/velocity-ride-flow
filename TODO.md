# TODO List for Navbar and Schedule Updates

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Install @google/generative-ai package
- [x] Create Chat.tsx component with Gemini API integration
- [x] Add Car icon before "Velocity" text in Navbar logo
- [x] Change Navbar background to matte finish (solid colors instead of backdrop-blur)
- [x] Update Schedule layout to 3-column grid (Calendar, Chat, Upcoming Rides)
- [x] Make calendar fill the entire card (removed padding wrapper)
- [x] Change all cards to rounded-3xl for seamless rounded appearance
- [x] Add Chat component beside the calendar

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test the Gemini API integration (requires VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable)

- [ ] Test calendar functionality and full-box filling
- [ ] Ensure chat component works properly with API calls
- [ ] Check responsive design on different screen sizes

## Notes
- Gemini API key needs to be set in environment variables as VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY
- Chat component includes error handling and loading states
- Navbar now uses solid matte backgrounds instead of glassy blur effects
- Calendar now occupies full card height without extra padding
- All cards use consistent rounded-3xl styling for seamless appearance
